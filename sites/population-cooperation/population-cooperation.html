	     <h3>The Importance of Representation</h3></center>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
    
     <p>It is undeniable that Indigenous individuals and communities are often placed at a major disadvantage when it comes to receiving sufficient political representation, funding, economic opportunity, and other essential resources from the federal government. More than 500 Native Nations in the United States continue to fight for a platform in our political and economic systems in order to address the problems that are unique to Indian Country. Rather than focusing on the shortcomings and injustices that are occuring in and around these Indigenous communities, we would like to highlight an example of how prioritizing Indigenous advocacy and political  representation at the State level can create the space that is needed for Native and non-Native communities to work together in harmony. We will be specifically looking at the state of Montana due to the number of Indigenous men and women within their State Legislature.  </p>

     </figure>
	     <p>The relationship between the United States and those of Native Americans has been built on a foundation of cultural genocide. However, Native American communities are resilient. They have survived persecution at the hands of settlers and settlers’ colonialist government. Native Americans have fought and continue to fight for their rights, to live within their culture and land. They have entered the United States political process, not as a way of surrender, but as a way to protect their sovereignty. <br>
Montana enjoys a proportional amount of Native American representation partly because of their commitment to enforcing voting rights. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 declared that Native Americans were U.S. citizens, and deserved to enjoy the same rights. The Voting Rights Act of 1965’s purpose was to end discriminatory voting eligibility practices, especially towards non-white citizens. However, states found other ways to discourage Native American voters. Montana is no exception. <br>
	For example, in 1937, Montana state law was that only federal taxpayers could vote. Since Native Americans are exempt from federal taxes, this barred them from the polls. Polling places also could not be hosted by reservations. These laws perpetuate a narrative between the states and Native governments of distrust. These laws were in effect until 1975.<br>
	Besides these laws, there are many other obstacles to the Native American vote. Many Native Americans residing on reservations live on or below the poverty level, lacking access to car insurance or fuel. This keeps many from being able to drive to local polling places, or even checking P.O. boxes. Montana’s weather can be especially harsh as well, with frequent blizzards in November barring people from travelling to the polls, or even being able to register.<br>
	With the help of grassroots organizations like <a href="https://www.mtnativevote.org/"> Montana Native Vote</a> and <a href="https://www.westernnativevoice.org/">Western Native Voice</a>, more indigenous people have been able to register than ever before. These non-profits gather absentee votes from the community and take them to the county election offices, taking the burden off the individual.

	     <p>American Indians make up 6.7% of Montana’s total population and 7.3% of members serving in State Legislature as of 2019. The percentage of legislators who identify as Native American has been steadily increasing from 0.6% in 1989 to 6.0% in 2017, the highest being 7.3% following the election in November 2018. This election produced the highest number of Indigenous members in legislature to date, the first time that Indigenous representation in government matched representation within the overall population. This representation has driven substantial legislation to protect Native American’s sovereignty. </p>

		     <p>Governor Bullock and Lt. Governor Cooney launched the Main Street Montana- Rural Partners Initiative in September of 2018. The goal of the project is to support small towns and communities within the state by having meetings between governmental representatives and the leaders of these communities to discuss both achievements and areas of concern. One focus of the project is to “reengage with tribal communities (Rural Partners: Main Street Montana).” This involves meeting with members from all 7 of the Indian reservations in Montana, and additionally with the state-recognized Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, to actively work on closing the gaps in resources, funding & governmental support, economic opportunity, and so on. These meetings provide an opportunity for Indigenous leaders from all over the state to voice their concerns, suggestions, and ideas.</p>
