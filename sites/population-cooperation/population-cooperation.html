     <p>It is undeniable that Indigenous individuals and communities are often placed at a major disadvantage when it comes to receiving sufficient political representation, funding, economic opportunity, and other essential resources from the federal government. More than 500 Native Nations in the United States continue to fight for a platform in our political and economic systems in order to address the problems that are unique to Indian Country. Rather than focusing on the shortcomings and injustices that are occuring in and around these Indigenous communities, we would like to highlight an example of how prioritizing Indigenous advocacy and political  representation at the State level can create the space that is needed for Native and non-Native communities to work together in harmony. We will be specifically looking at the state of Montana due to the number of Indigenous men and women within their State Legislature. American Indians make up 6.7% of Montana’s total population and 7.3% of members serving in State Legislature as of 2019. The percentage of legislators who identify as Native American has been steadily increasing from 0.6% in 1989 to 6.0% in 2017, the highest being 7.3% following the election in November 2018. This election produced the highest number of Indigenous members in legislature to date, the first time that Indigenous representation in government matched representation within the overall population. This representation has driven substantial legislation to protect Native American’s sovereignty.  </p>
