		 <p>
       Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls want to introduce Native Women's Association of Canada, also known as NWAC. This organization is a
foundation that strives to "enhance, promote, and foster the social, economic, cultural and political well-being of First Nations and Metis and
Canadian societies". This foundation is a non-profit organization since 1974. NWAC has a violence and prevention focus around violence against
Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse. Here, we wanted to focus on awareness and prevention of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls,
and gender-diverse. The reason for this focus is because there is an increasing amount of Indigenous women coming up missing and murdered. This
webpage will reside in details of how the NWAC has brought to light awareness and prevention for this rising issue within the Canadian community.
The end goal is to connect to the anthropological theory that one's experience can bring forth the face of understanding and peace to this topic.

  This page wants to give you a look on violence and its significance. As like Australian Aboriginal people, it is obvious that the Canadian community
may also feel invisible to this topic. There is a lot of things that go unnoticed or unfocused when it comes to violence against women before us, or
even now. The importance here is to not leave victims to have to tell their own story and to become their own self-appointed spokesperson. The goal
is to be a voice for the Canadian community, and to help raise awareness on something sensitive. According to the NWAC, the United Nations defines
violence against woemn as a "gender-based violence that can result in physical, sexual or psychoological harm or suffering". The bigger picture is
understanding that women of the Canadian community will never feel invisible, so long as they have others backing them to help spread awareness and
prevention tactics to the unknowing crowd. When we think of unknown, we can look at millennials today, and just modern-day society as the unknown
audience. This topic is not being taught in history classes in high schools. This is a topic that is now being introduced in the college world, only
if you take an Indian history course. Violence is to be understood as something that can become a long-term issue one has to live with, because during
a violent experience one person experiences something traumatic in their life. This page is to help us connect with women in an earlier time through
awareness and prevention.

Purpose of the MMIWG & Violence Prevention Policy
  The Native Women's Association of Canada has been working diligently towards resolving the senseless acts of violence affecting women, girls, and
gender-diverse within Indigenous communities. The main purpose of their work is to provide healing and support services with long-term funding; these
services are available for the community and family of these missing and murdered women, girls, and gender-diverse. By completing this, the NWAC
hopes to create a community based around building strength and resilience ("Vision Statement"), as well as empower the indigenous community. They have
created at least four educational and awareness based 'toolkits' for indigenous peoples to utilize. The 'toolkits' discussed below are: Honouring
Indigenous Women, You Are Not Alone, Sisters in Spirit, and the Faceless Doll Project.
Honouring Indigenous Women
  Indigenous communities, specifically the traditional roles individuals take on, were deeply affected by colonizers. With the Honouring Indigenous
Women toolkit, the NWAC is attempting to give Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse the means to reclaim their heritage, as well as reinstate
honor, empowerment, and respect to Native American culture and community. Furthermore, the NWAC hope to provide insight into a better understanding
of the roles their ancestors took on. By doing so, they are able to give Indigenous youth a safe platform, where they can strengthen their
understanding of traditional Indigenous values and heritage. Their focus for Indigenous youth resides in "traditional roles on women, defining
respect and honor, valuing one's self, mindfulness, sustainability in culture, 2SLGBTQQIA, MMIWG and more" ("Honouring Indigenous Women"). This
prepares these young children to think critically about future issues that may arise in Indigenous communities, and any personal adversities they may
face. It brings them closer to their community and ancestry, as well.
You Are Not Alone
  Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse are frequently confronted with the harsh reality of a settler colonial society. Years of discrimination,
sexism, and racism have led to higher violence rates towards Indigenous women, than non-Indigenous women; the violence encountered commonly takes
place within Indigenous families and communities. Indigenous women who are trapped in an abusive relationship will often lack the necessary resources
to escape. The NWAC is providing victims of domestic violence with a safely planning toolkit to address their personal situation, as well as various
educational resources (such as background information on how colonization has affected native communities, topics relating to domestic violence,
support systems available within their community, and strategies for leaving an abuser.) Their goal is to support these women, and help them to
realize they have the ability to change their environment for the better. The You Are Not Alone toolkit is helping to slowly eliminate the level
of violence found in indigenous communities; it creates a healthy, safe, and happy environment for future generations to thrive.
Sisters in Spirit
  Sisters in Spirit was originally created as a research and awareness initiative
